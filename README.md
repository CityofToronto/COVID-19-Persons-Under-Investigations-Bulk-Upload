# COVID-19 Persons-Under-Investigations Bulk Upload Guidelines

## CSV Upload file format

The CSV upload **MUST** follow the required format. Each CSV field (column) is described in the [CSV_Fields.md](CSV_Fields.md) file. 

For technical specification for how each  field will be validated upon upload, please review the [JSON-schema](CORES_Bulk-JSON_Schema.json) 

As a starting point, review the [example CSV file](CORES-example.csv) with TEST data.
